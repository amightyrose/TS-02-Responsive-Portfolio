# TS-02-Responsive-Portfolio

The aim of this project is to create a website introducing myself and showcasing my work as a web developer.

## Requirements

The website needs to meet the following criteria:
* Be a 'mobile-first', responsive website.
* Built using Bootstrap, particularly with Bootstrap's grid layout.
* Minimise the use of media queries.
* Features a navbar that is consistent across all pages.
* Has three pages: bio, portfolio and contact.
* Uses semantic HTML.

## Preview

The following screenshots show the portfolio page at three different screen sizes:
